support clean system installation including dotfiles

##  Set Up Continuous Integration
To fully test this repo, we need to start each time with a clean device.
Use model from [CI your MacOS Dotfiles with GitHub Actions!](https://mattorb.com/ci-your-dotfiles-with-github-actions/) to set this up so each test is a new install on a GitHub Action-provided virtual machine.
